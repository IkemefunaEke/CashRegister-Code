# CashRegister-Code
I wrote code for a cash register that returns the change according to the denomimation of money
The function takes 3 values price of the item, cash paid and the cash in register and returns and object with the status of the drawer and the change according to the denomination of the money
It is quite complex and I use ES6 objects and loops in it
